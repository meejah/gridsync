# Qt 5.15.2 is broken on Debian 10; see https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-88688
# Note that these version-pins are purposefully *not* propagated to setup.py
# in order to allow unaffected systems/environments that rely on distutils to
# use newer versions of PyQt5; we still want to keep a Qt 5.15.1 pin here,
# however -- mostly so that our PyInstaller-generated binaries will continue
# to run on as many systems as possible.
pyqt5 == 5.15.1
pyqt5-sip == 12.8.1
pyqtchart == 5.15.1
